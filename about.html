        	<p>Our intent is to provide a neighborhood restaurant for locals to relax and enjoy the company of their neighbors and children over a bottle of wine or with a craft brew. We are not a fast food restaurant. All of our pizza dough, sausage, and sauce is made in house and cooked in our Italian built wood fired (local orange wood) pizza oven. Our distinctive tables as well as light fixtures were built by Lori as well.</p>
